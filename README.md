# Financial App
This is an application example of using Yahoo finance API with MVVM and SWIFTUI.  
Note: Yahoo finance API is not open nowadays. So the App is is not fetching entities quotes.

## Structure
Project group organization:  

    .  
    ├── DataService                   # Service interface
    ├── Common                        # All reused structure
    ├── Model                         # Models for organize structure
    ├── Others                        # Extensions, mocks...
    ├── View                          # All views used in the project
    └── ViewModel                     # All viewmodels

## Things I would do if I had more time
1. Create a home with a list of saved quotes
2. Cover more code with tests
3. Create my own data service
